# Base Pay Integration Guide

This app uses **Base Pay** to accept USDC payments for XP points and in-app purchases.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Configure Your Recipient Address

Edit `src/config/basePay.ts` and update the recipient address:

```typescript
export const PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = '0xYourWalletAddress'; // Replace with your address
```

### 2. Choose Network Mode

For testing:
```typescript
export const IS_TESTNET = true; // Use Base Sepolia testnet
```

For production:
```typescript
export const IS_TESTNET = false; // Use Base Mainnet
```

## üí∞ How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Buy XP" button
2. Base Pay popup appears (handled by Base Account SDK)
3. User pays with USDC from their Base Account or Coinbase Account
4. Payment is confirmed on-chain
5. XP is credited to user's account

### Payment Flow
```
XPStore Component
    ‚Üì
processPayment() - Initiates payment with Base Pay SDK
    ‚Üì
pollPaymentStatus() - Polls until transaction is confirmed
    ‚Üì
addXP() - Credits XP to user's balance
```

```
