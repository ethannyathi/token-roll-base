# Simple XP System Explanation

## ‚úÖ Simplified Implementation - Option A

The app now uses a **simple, clear XP points system** with no confusing sub accounts.

## How It Works (Simple!)

### 1. Connect Your Main Wallet

- Use Coinbase Wallet or any Base-compatible wallet
- This is your identity and how you buy XP

### 2. Buy XP Points
- Click "Buy XP" button
- Choose a package ($5, $10, $25, or $50)
- Payment comes from your **main wallet**
- XP is credited to you instantly

### 3. Where Are XP Points Stored?

**Current (Demo):**
- üìÇ **Browser localStorage** 
- Key: `user_xp_state_<your_wallet_address>`
- Linked to your wallet address
- Persists between sessions on the same browser

**Production (Future):**
- üóÑÔ∏è **Secure database**
- Linked to your wallet address
- Accessible from any browser/device
- Backed up and secure

### 4. Bet with XP
- Choose bet amount (10-500 XP)
- Click "Play & Match"
- XP deducted from your balance (in localStorage)
- **No blockchain transaction** = No gas fees!
- **Instant** = No waiting for confirmations

### 5. Win or Lose

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

- **Cheap**: No gas fees per bet
- **Simple**: Easy to understand

### What About Sub Accounts?

**Removed!** They were confusing because:
- ‚ùå XP is stored off-chain (not on blockchain)
- ‚ùå No blockchain transactions per bet
- ‚ùå Sub accounts are for on-chain transactions
- ‚ùå Added complexity with no benefit

## FAQ

**Q: Where is my XP stored?**
A: In your browser's localStorage, linked to your wallet address. In production, it would be in a database.

**Q: Can I lose my XP?**
A: Demo: If you clear browser data, yes. Production: No, it's safely stored in a database.

**Q: Why not use blockchain for everything?**
A: Too slow and expensive for rapid gameplay. Buying XP uses blockchain once, then you play fast!

**Q: What happened to Sub Accounts?**
A: Removed to reduce confusion. They're for on-chain transactions, but we're doing off-chain betting.

**Q: Is this "real" crypto?**
A: You buy XP with real crypto. The betting happens off-chain for speed. Think of it like casino chips!

## Summary

**Simple Flow:**
1. Connect wallet ‚úÖ
2. Buy XP with crypto ‚úÖ
3. Bet XP instantly ‚úÖ
4. Win/Lose XP ‚úÖ
5. (Optional) Cash out XP back to crypto

**No more confusion about:**
