## üöÄ Go to Production

### Before Mainnet Deployment:

1. **Update Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // src/config/basePay.ts
   export const PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = '0xYourProductionWallet';
   export const IS_TESTNET = false; // ‚Üê Change to false
   ```

2. **Test on Testnet First**
   - [ ] Test all payment flows
   - [ ] Test error scenarios (insufficient funds, canceled payments)
   - [ ] Verify XP crediting works
   - [ ] Check transaction IDs are logged

3. **Replace localStorage**
   - [ ] Set up database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
   - [ ] Create API endpoints for XP management
   - [ ] Add wallet address ‚Üí user ID mapping
   - [ ] Store transaction history

4. **Add Server Validation**
   - [ ] Verify payments on backend
   - [ ] Use webhooks for instant updates
   - [ ] Add fraud detection
   - [ ] Rate limit payment endpoints

5. **Security Checklist**
   - [ ] Never trust client-side XP amounts
   - [ ] Validate all payments server-side
   - [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
   - [ ] Set up alerts for payment failures

6. **Deploy**
   - [ ] Deploy backend first
   - [ ] Deploy frontend
   - [ ] Test one small payment on mainnet
   - [ ] Monitor for issues
   - [ ] Gradually increase limits
